# Python Pipeline

To run Python scripts within SeaTable, you need to install the Python Pipeline â€” an environment utilizing Docker containers for script execution and result retrieval. Thanks to the SeaTable Python API you can seamlessly interact with the data in the base.

Explore various use cases from other SeaTable users:

- Retrieve current stock prices and store them in SeaTable.
- Validate DNS settings of specified domains for specific TXT entries.
- Capture submissions from form.io and store the results.
- Identify duplicate entries and apply specific tags.

## Installation

This article explains how to add the Python Pipeline on your SeaTable server.

#### 1. Change the .env file

To install the Python Pipeline, include `python-pipeline.yml` in the `COMPOSE_FILE` variable within your `.env` file. This instructs Docker to download the required images for the Python Pipeline.

Simply copy and paste (:material-content-copy:) the following code into your command line:

```bash
sed -i "s/COMPOSE_FILE='\(.*\)'/COMPOSE_FILE='\1,python-pipeline.yml'/" /opt/seatable-compose/.env
```

!!! warning "Don't use space"

    When manually adding `python-pipeline.yml` to the `COMPOSE_FILE` variable using your preferred editor, ensure that you avoid any space (:material-keyboard-space:). After making this modification, your `COMPOSE_FILE` variable should look like this:

    ```bash
    COMPOSE_FILE='caddy.yml,seatable-server.yml,python-pipeline.yml'
    ```

#### 2. Generate a shared secret for secure communication

For secure communication between SeaTable and the Python Pipeline, a shared secret is required to prevent unauthorized access or usage. We recommend utilizing `pwgen` to generate a robust and secure password. Copy and paste the following command into your command line to generate a password:

```bash
pw=$(pwgen -s 40 1) && echo "Generated shared secret: ${pw}"
```

#### 3. Update the configuration

The generated shared secret needs to be added to both your `.env` file and the configuration files of your SeaTable Server.

Copy and paste the following commands to include the shared secret in the `.env` file:

```bash
echo -e "\n# python-pipeline" >> /opt/seatable-compose/.env
echo "PYTHON_SCHEDULER_AUTH_TOKEN=${pw}" >> /opt/seatable-compose/.env
```

Now execute this command to add the required configuration to `dtable_web_settings.py`:

```bash
echo -e "\n# python-pipeline" >> /opt/seatable-server/seatable/conf/dtable_web_settings.py
echo "SEATABLE_FAAS_URL = 'http://python-scheduler'" >> /opt/seatable-server/seatable/conf/dtable_web_settings.py
echo "SEATABLE_FAAS_AUTH_TOKEN = '${pw}'" >> /opt/seatable-server/seatable/conf/dtable_web_settings.py
```

#### 4. Start the Python Pipeline

Now it is time to start the Python Pipeline.

```bash
cd /opt/seatable-compose && \
docker compose up -d && \
docker exec -d seatable /shared/seatable/scripts/seatable.sh start
```

#### 5. Check if the Python Pipeline is running

Do you want to execute your first python script in SeaTable? Nothing easier than that.

- Login to your SeaTable Server with your Browser.
- Create a new base and access it.
- Add a python script with the content `print("Hello World")` and execute it. If you don't know how to do this, check out our [user manual](https://seatable.io/docs/javascript-python/anlegen-und-loeschen-eines-skriptes/?lang=auto).

If everything went right, you should see the output `Hello World`.

:material-party-popper: **Great!** Your SeaTable can execute Python scripts now.

## Workflow of the Python Pipeline in a nutshell

This is a short explanation what happens, if you click on "Run script" inside SeaTable.

### SeaTable Server

To initialize the Python Pipeline, SeaTable-Server makes a request to the API-endpoint /run-script/ of the scheduler. This call is authenticated by the shared secret, defined in dtable_web_settings.py. Ever two seconds (and for max. 15 minutes), the SeaTable Server checks the status of the script execution by calling `/script-result/` from the scheduler.

### SeaTable Scheduler

The scheduler creates a new task in the mariadb database. The scheduler calls the API-endpoint `/function/run-python` of the starter. Now the scheduler waits for the run to finish and write the duration and the output to the database.

### SeaTable Starter

The starter downloads the python script directly from SeaTable Server and saves the script to a temporary folder on the hard drive of the host. The starter now starts a python-runner container and mounts the script as input. After completion the runner container is deleted.

### SeaTable Runner

SeaTable runner executes the python script and writes the output to the same temporary folder on the host. After that the container stops.

### Important points

- dtable-web only queries the result as long as the browser is open (manual execution).
- if an automation starts a python script, SeaTable Server waits max. 15 minutes for the run to finish.
- starter and runner communicate via the exchange directory. this must be available as a volume to both containers
- starter and scheduler communicate via api calls and database.
- the python runner is stopped after 15 minutes at the latest
- the scheduler has a cleanup process to invalidate work orders in the database that run for longer than 15 minutes.
- the task is stored in the database for some days (30 days by default)

## Configuration

The Python Pipeline provides multiple environment variables for further customization. The available parameters are:

```bash
