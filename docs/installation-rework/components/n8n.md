# Installation of the automation platform n8n

The installation of an automation plattform like n8n increases the power. Connect to other software solutions, gather logs or data from other tools.

## Installation

This guide shows how to install **n8n** on your SeaTable server.

#### 1. Change the .env file

Like with all additional components you first have to add the `n8n.yml` to the `COMPOSE_FILE` variable in your `.env` file.
First open the config file.

```bash
nano /opt/seatable-compose/.env
```

Now add n8n.yml to the `COMPOSE_FILE` variable. Don't remove anything and don't use :material-keyboard-space:!

```bash
COMPOSE_FILE='caddy.yml,seatable-server.yml,n8n.yml'
```

#### 2. Generate secrets for your postgres database

Generate inital secrets and write them into your .env file.

```
echo -e "\n# n8n" >> /opt/seatable-compose/.env
echo "POSTGRES_PASSWORD=$(pwgen -s 40 1)" >> /opt/seatable-compose/.env
echo "POSTGRES_NON_ROOT_PASSWORD=$(pwgen -s 40 1)" >> /opt/seatable-compose/.env
```

#### 3. Start n8n

```bash
cd /opt/seatable-compose && \
docker compose up -d
```

#### 4. Create initial admin user

Your n8n Container provides a Web UI to set up your n8n Admin User under `https://<your-seatable-server-hostname>:6231`.
