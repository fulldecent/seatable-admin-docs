# Basic installation of a SeaTable Server

!!! danger "PREVIEW / This installation method is not yet ready for production"

    We always try to make the installation of SeaTable as easy as possible. Therefore we will recommend in the near future the usage of caddy to simplify the complete SSL termination. Also we will introduce a global enviroment file for easier configuration. As soon as this new installation method is ready, we will update this manual accordingly.

#### This manual describes the installation of a SeaTable Server on a Linux OS using Docker.

We want to provide an easy installation method, that will lead to an up and runnning SeaTable system within minutes. These steps where tested on Debian and Ubuntu based Systems.
If you come across a problem or somthing is unclear please create a post at the [SeaTable community forum](https://forum.seatable.io).
We are happy to help and will improve this manual if needed.

!!! warning "Docker required"

    SeaTable uses `docker` and `docker compose` plugin. If Docker is not supported by your platform, you cannot install SeaTable Server with this manual.

!!! tip "Want to watch a step-by-step video instead of reading a manual?"

The installation is done via the command line as `root` user.


## Install basic tools
The following command installs basic tools that are used in the following manual. Usually all these tools are already installed on your linux server.

```bash
apt update && \
apt -y install curl pwgen tree wget tar
```

## Install Docker and Docker Compose Plugin
 If you are in a testing enviroment you can use this get.docker.com convenience script to install docker and docker compose.
 In a production enviroment or otherwise please refer to the [official installation instructions of docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

```bash
curl -fsSL get.docker.com | bash
```

## Install SeaTable Server
This installation assumes that all components of SeaTable are installed below `/opt`.
We recommended to keep this folder structure.

#### 1. Create directory & Download required files & Copy .env file
    mkdir /opt/seatable-compose && \
    cd /opt/seatable-compose && \
    wget -c https://github.com/seatable/seatable-release/releases/download/v4.2.11/seatable-compose.tar.gz \
    -O - | tar -xz -C /opt/seatable-compose && \
    cp -n .env-release .env

#### 2. Change .env file (Enviroment Configuration file)

!!! warning "Only modify the `.env` file"

    In most cases there should be no need to change anything in the compose.yml files.

```bash
nano /opt/seatable-compose/.env
```

=== "SeaTable Enterprise Edition"

    ``` python
    ## select the components to be installed
    COMPOSE_FILE='seatable-docker-proxy.yml,seatable-server.yml' # (1)!

    ## seatable server
    SEATABLE_SERVER_HOSTNAME='seatable.example.com'  # (3)!
    SEATABLE_PATH='/opt/seatable-server' # (4)!
    TIME_ZONE='Europe/Berlin' # (2)!

    ```

    1.  COMPOSE_FILE is a comma separated list **without spaces**. It defines which components should be run. `seatable-docker-proxy.yml` and `seatable-server.yml` are a typical combination for a base system.
    2.  Get a [list of timezones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) from Wikipedia.
    3.  Select your domain or subdomain that points to your Server (without https://). You have to set an A-Record or CNAME pointing to your IP.
    4.  Only change the path if you are an experienced docker and linux admin.

=== "SeaTable Developer Edition"

    ``` python
    ## use the seatable-dev-server.yml instead of the seatable-server.yml
    ## otherwise refer to the SeaTable Enterprise Edition section
    COMPOSE_FILE='seatable-docker-proxy.yml,seatable-dev-server.yml'

    ```

#### 3. Generate inital secrets and write them into your .env file

    echo "SEATABLE_MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=$(pwgen -s 40 1)" >> /opt/seatable-compose/.env
    echo "SEATABLE_ADMIN_PASSWORD=$(pwgen -s 40 1)" >> /opt/seatable-compose/.env

#### 4. Get a license

This step is only necessary, if you want to install SeaTable Enterprise Edition. You can skip this step if you install SeaTable Developer Edition.  
**Please replace `email@example.com` with a valid email address of yours.**

```
curl https://get.seatable.io/license/email@example.com
```

Download the license to the current directory, like it is described in the email you just received.

!!! success "Three users, two years - for free."

    You will receive a license for up to three users which is valid for two years.  
    If you like SeaTable and are considering a bigger license, please [contact us](https://seatable.io/kontakt/?lang=auto).

#### 5. Start the server

Run`tree -a /opt/seatable-compose`, the output should look like this:

    /opt/seatable-compose
    ├── .env
    ├── .env-release
    ├── seatable-docker-proxy.yml
    ├── seatable-licence.txt
    ├── seatable-onlyoffice.yml
    ├── seatable-python-pipeline.yml
    └── seatable-server.yml

If everything is in place, execute the following command to download and start the docker images for the first time.

```bash
docker compose up
```

Wait for a while. When you see `This is an idle script (infinite loop) to keep container running.` in the output log, the database has been initialized successfully. Press `CTRL/Control + C` to return to the prompt.

!!! warning "Change scheme to https"
    At this time all configuration files are created with `http://` instead of `https://`. This can be fixed with the following command:

    ```
    source .env
    sed -i "s|http://${SEATABLE_SERVER_HOSTNAME}|https://${SEATABLE_SERVER_HOSTNAME}|g" /opt/seatable-server/seatable/conf/dtable_web_settings.py
    ```

Now it is time to run `docker compose` again. This time in detached mode:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

#### 6. SeaTable process and initial superuser creation

After the first start it is necessary to create an initial admin user and to start the main SeaTable process. In an upcoming version these steps will not be necessary anymore.

```
docker exec -d seatable /shared/seatable/scripts/seatable.sh start
```
```
docker exec -it seatable /shared/seatable/scripts/seatable.sh superuser
```

!!! Tip "Docker parameters"

    The first command uses the option `-d` which starts the service in the background.  
    The second command uses the option `-it` which runs the command in interactive mode.

Enter the email address and the initial password of the admin user.  
`Superuser created successfully` confirms the creation of the admin user.

You can now access SeaTable at the host name specified in the `.env` file.

!!! success "Automatic SSL Termination"

    This setup uses Caddy as the main webserver. Caddy runs with no addtional or only a minimal amount of configuration and is able to automatically deal with let's encrypt certificates if you choose to use them. That inclused the autorenewal of the certificates.
