    Additionally, there is [SeaTable Cloud](https://cloud.seatable.io), a cloud service for users that do not want to self-host or simply trial SeaTable Server. SeaTable Cloud can be used free-of-charge with the "Free" subscription. More features and higher resource limits are available in [SeaTable Cloud's paid subscriptions](https://seatable.io/preise/?lang=auto).

## Installation

This manual provides two different approaches how to install SeaTable.

### Single-Node Installation

There is a _Single-Node Setup_, where all components of SeaTable are installed on one Server or virtual machine. All services can be reached by one single URL. The installation is fairly straigt forward thanks to the consequent usage of Docker. This setup is easy for testing and production for up to 100 users.

### Advanced Setup

The _advanced setup_ is not an installation type, but the articles in this section provide the necessary information to operate each component separately. The descriptions result in a highly available cluster setup for thousands of users.
